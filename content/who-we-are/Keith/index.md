Keith Southam is the founder and principal attorney of Southam Law LLC. Keith founded Southam Law with the dual goals of helping clients understand their cases and of keeping costs down. Keith knows how important these things are. Keithâ€™s grandparents were immigrants, and he was raised by a single mother. This taught Keith compassion for the struggles of immigrants, people who do not speak English well, and working families. Keith earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and German Literature from the University of Idaho, a Master of Arts in Teaching English as a Second Language from Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville, and Juris Doctor degree from the Chicago-Kent College of Law. Prior to law school, Keith worked for several years as an international student advisor and an ESL teacher. In law school, Keith focused on immigration law, including a student research project on asylum, an internship at the Chicago Immigration Court, and a job as a law clerk for an immigration attorney. Before opening Southam Law, Keith worked for five years as an associate attorney in a small immigration firm in Chicago. Keith has also lived outside of the US (in Germany, where his grandparents came from). In addition to English, Keith speaks Spanish, German, French, and Swedish.
