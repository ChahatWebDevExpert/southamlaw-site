Jesus Faria is a paralegal at Southam Law LLC. Jesus is originally from Maracaibo, Venezuela. He fled the dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela in 2017. Having to leave his home and family in Venezuela was a hard choice, but Jesus was able to get an F-1 student visa to study in the US. Since then, he has applied for asylum and was recently granted temporary protected status (TPS). Jesus knows how hard it is to be an immigrant in a foreign country. His personal experiences have given him empathy to understand and help clients. Jesus earned a law degree from Universidad del Zulia and worked as an attorney in Venezuela before coming to the United States. He hopes to take the LSAT and apply for law school in the United States. In his free time, Jesus likes reading all kinds of books especially mystery, romance, science fiction and fantasy. Jesus is a big fan of Harry Potter.
