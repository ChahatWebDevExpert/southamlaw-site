## Why have these Terms and Conditions?

These Terms and Conditions accompany a Legal Services Agreement (that is, a contract). If You asked Southam Law LLC to help you with a specific application or case, Southam Law LLC will ask You to sign a Legal Services Agreement. These Terms and Conditions give more detailed rules to the Legal Services Agreement between You and Southam Law LLC. In the Legal Services Agreement and in these Terms and Conditions, the word “You” means the person or persons who signed the Legal Services Agreement, and the word “Agreement” means the Legal Services Agreement.

## What is the reason for the Agreement?

The Agreement is a contract between You and Southam Law LLC. In this You are giving Southam Law LLC power of attorney. This gives Southam Law LLC the power and authority to act (or decline to act) in any way that You could act (or decline to act) in order to fulfill the services noted in the Agreement. Southam Law LLC will work through its attorneys, staff members, and contractors to complete the work noted in the Agreement.

## How long will the Agreement last?

The Agreement enters into force when You sign it and return it to Southam Law LLC.

1. If immigration officials approve Your application or case, 
1. If immigration officials deny Your application or case,
1. If You or Southam Law LLC suspends services,
1. If immigration officials issue a receipt in Your application or case (this provision applies if Your Agreement includes only the service of filing and submitting an application but does not include ongoing monitoring, further assistance, or interview preparation), or
1. If one year has passed since the first immigration interview in Your case (this provision applies if Your Agreement includes an interview with immigration officials).

Southam Law LLC will send You written notice when services have concluded.

## How should You communicate with Southam Law LLC?

This is a business relationship between You and Southam Law LLC that will last for some time. For that reason, communication is critical.

In this Agreement, You agree to communicate with all members of Southam Law LLC staff, not just attorneys. In this Agreement, You also agree to maintain and check an email account.

Because Southam Law LLC balances nearly three hundred cases at a time and  because attorneys and staff members are often in meetings, at immigration offices, working from home, etc., Southam Law LLC encourages you to follow these communication guidelines.

If You attend the event alone or if You select a substitute attorney, Southam Law LLC will refund or discount an appropriate sum (based on completed/outstanding work) to You. If Southam Law LLC selects a substitute attorney, Southam Law LLC will pay that attorney directly. 

## What happens if spouses, family members, or employers/employees disagree?

At this time, because both parties have the same goal, Southam Law LLC is confident that it can provide these services. However, if Your goals stop being the same, Southam Law LLC cannot continue to represent You both. In such a situation, Southam Law LLC will suspend services pending guidance from You. Southam Law LLC does not represent any other persons or entities.
