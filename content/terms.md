## Why have these Terms and Conditions?

These Terms and Conditions accompany a Legal Partnership Agreement (that is, a contract). If You asked Southam Law LLC to help you with a specific application or case, Southam Law LLC will ask You to sign a Legal Partnership Agreement. These Terms and Conditions give more detailed rules to the Legal Partnership Agreement between You and Southam Law LLC. In the Legal Partnership Agreement and in these Terms and Conditions, the word “You” means the person or persons who signed the Legal Partnership Agreement, and the word “Agreement” means the Legal Partnership Agreement.

## What is the reason for the Agreement?

The Agreement is a contract between You and Southam Law LLC. In this You are giving Southam Law LLC power of attorney. This gives Southam Law LLC the power and authority to act (or decline to act) in any way that You could act (or decline to act) in order to fulfill the services noted in the Agreement. Southam Law LLC will work through its attorneys, staff members, and contractors to complete the work noted in the Agreement.

## What is included and excluded in the Agreement?

Your Agreement indicates the specific services that are included in Your Agreement. Southam Law LLC agrees only to the services noted in Your Agreement. Your Agreement also lists exclusions, and more details of exclusions is found on the Exclusions and Extra-Cost Services list: https://southamlaw.com/exclusions/. In the event that a service does not appear on Your Agreement or on the Exclusions and Extra-Cost Services list, that service is excluded.

## What are the costs for services and payment schedule?

Your Agreement indicates the total cost of these legal services, the amount of Your initial payment, and the amount of any monthly payments. You agree to pay these fees promptly. You can find more information about how to make a payment on the Payments page: https://southamlaw.com/payment/.

## Will fees increase?

Your Agreement is a fixed fee. The fee will not increase or decrease except in the following circumstances. If You or Southam Law LLC suspends services early, the fee for services may increase or decrease (as noted in the "What happens if You or Southam Law LLC suspends services?" section below). In addition, Southam Law LLC may rarely have to charge fees for urgent translation or urgent mailing services as noted in the Excluded and Extra-Cost Services list: https://southamlaw.com/exclusions/. In addition, if You make and then fail to keep an appointment with a member of Southam Law LLC's staff, You will be charged a missed appointment fee as noted in the Excluded and Extra-Cost Services page. You agree to pay these additional fees if they are incurred.

## How long will the Agreement last?

The Agreement enters into force when You sign it and return it to Southam Law LLC.

The Agreement will continue to have effect and Southam Law LLC will continue to provide services as described in Your Agreement until one of these events happens:

-Approval of Your application or case,
-Denial of Your application or case,
-Suspension of services under this Agreement (by You or by Southam Law LLC), or
-the "Natural End" of Your application or case.

The “Natural End” of services is connected to the type of service. Your Agreement will indicate whether the services consist of preparing and submitting an application or whether the services consist representation at an interview or court hearing. If Your Agreement is for preparing and submitting and application, the “Natural End” of services occurs when immigration officials issue a receipt or acknowledgement of the application or submission. (However, the services will resume if immigration officials issue a “Request for Evidence” or “RFE” in Your application or case.) If Your Agreement is for representation at an interview or court hearing, the “Natural End” of services occurs at the conclusion of the interview or hearing. (However, if the interview or hearing is postponed or cancelled, the “Natural End” occurs when Southam Law LLC or You learn of the postponement or cancellation).

When services have concluded, Southam Law LLC will send You written notice at the last email address and postal address You provided to Southam Law LLC.

## Can Southam Law LLC guarantee an approval or other decision?

Southam Law LLC offers no guarantees. Attorneys, staff members, and contractors will use best efforts and practices to achieve Your goals. However, Southam Law LLC cannot make any guarantee of success or any other outcome. Only immigration officials have this power.

## Can Southam Law LLC guarantee a speedy decision or help speed up a decision?

Southam Law LLC has no control over the time it takes immigration officials to reach a decision.

Southam Law LLC will only inquire about delays or request that immigration officials expedite a case if You are facing a real life-or-death emergency. Even then, Southam Law LLC cannot offer any guarantee about the response from immigration officials.

## How should You communicate with Southam Law LLC?

Maintaining Your email account includes promptly resolving a full inbox without the need for Southam Law LLC to ask you to do so.

Because Southam Law LLC balances hundreds of cases at a time and because attorneys and staff members are often in meetings, at immigration offices, working from home, etc., Southam Law LLC encourages You to follow these communication guidelines. Please use email or text messages. Please give Southam Law LLC 48 business hours to reply to text messages, emails, and voice messages. If You have an emergency, please text Southam Law LLC for a faster response. Be sure to use the word "emergency" in your text message.

## What happens if there is a schedule conflict?

Southam Law LLC will make every effort to avoid schedule conflicts, but sometimes schedule conflicts are unavoidable.

You may chose to reschedule the event, to attend the event alone, or to attend the event with a substitute attorney. If You attend the event alone or if You select a substitute attorney, Southam Law LLC will refund or discount an appropriate sum (based on completed/outstanding work) to You. If Southam Law LLC selects a substitute attorney, Southam Law LLC will pay that attorney directly.

## What happens if spouses, family members, or employers/employees disagree?

If Southam Law LLC is representing two persons in Your case or if Southam Law LLC is representing both an employer and an employee, You should consider this section.
